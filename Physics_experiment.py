#Â Start
# Create a function called 'average_calculation' that calculates the average of the items in a list.
# Create a function called 'variance' to calculate the variance (square of the difference of the values and the means).
# Create a function called 'standard_deviation' that is the square root of the variance.
# Create a dictionary called 'locations' which stores the different radiation levels in a list for each of the locations.
# For each of the locations in the dictionary:
    # Display the average radiation level.
# For each of the locations in the dictionary:
    # Display the standard deviation of the radiation levels.
# While a user would like to enter a new radiation level to locations:
    # If a user enters 'Done':
        # Debug and exit the programme.
    # Else, if a user decides to type one of the locations in the dictionary:
        # Whilst a user wishes to enter values for the location they have chosen to enter values for:
            # if the user enters 'Done':
                # Exit this loop to enable the user to choose another location to enter values for
                # or to exit the programme altogether.
            # When the user enter a radiation level:
                # Add the new values to the list of the chosen location (key-value pair) from the dictionary.
            # However, if the user enters anything except 'Done' or an integer:
                # Display that the input could not be recognised and ask the user to try again.
# If the length of the list in the locations dictionary exceeds the original length (5):
    # for each location in the locations dictionary:
        # Calculate and display the average radiation levels including the new values that the user has entered.
    # for each location in the locations dictionary:
        # Calculate and display the standard deviation radiation levels including the new values that the user has entered.
# Otherwise:
    # Inform the user that no new values were entered.
